# MapUp - Analytics Dashboard Assessment

## Overview

The objective of this assessment is to analyze the provided Electric Vehicle (EV) population data and create a frontend dashboard that visualizes key insights about the dataset. This repository contains the necessary data and instructions for you to demonstrate your analytical and dashboard creation skills. Feel free to use any tech stack you want to create the dashboard.

## Dataset

The Electric Vehicle Population dataset is available in the [Electric Vehicle Population Data (CSV)](./data-to-visualize/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv) within this repository, for more information about the dataset visit [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population).

**Note:** We've reduced the dataset in the repository to keep the data size small in the frontend bundle.

## Tasks

### Dashboard Creation:

- Create a frontend dashboard that presents key insights from the dataset.
- Design the dashboard to effectively communicate important metrics and visualizations.
- Include visual representations such as charts, graphs, or tables to showcase trends and relationships in the data.
- Ensure the dashboard is user-friendly and intuitive for exploring the dataset.

### Deployment:

- Deploy your frontend dashboard to a hosting platform of your choice.
- Make sure the dashboard is publicly accessible.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- **Analytical Depth:** The depth of your analysis and insights derived from the dataset.
- **Dashboard Design:** Clarity, aesthetics, and usability of the frontend dashboard.
- **Insightfulness:** Effectiveness in conveying key insights about electric vehicles.

## Submission Guidelines

- Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
- Complete your analysis and create the frontend dashboard.
- Deploy the dashboard to a hosting platform.
- Update this [README.md](README.md) file with the URL to your live dashboard.
- **Repository Access:** Keep your repository private to avoid visibility by other candidates. Add the following email addresses as collaborators to the repository, these are our internal emails and will be evaluating your assessment:
  - vedantp@mapup.ai
  - ajayap@mapupa.ai
  - divyanshs@mapup.ai
- Finally, please fill out the google form that you received via email to submit the assessment for review.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
